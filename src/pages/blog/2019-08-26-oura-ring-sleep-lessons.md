# Oura Ring Sleep Lessons



\-No sugar /big meals 2 hours before sleep. Your body has to digest the food.



\-Try to sleep at the same time every night. You are essentially giving yourself jet-lag when you stay up late.



\-Keep your room as cold as possible & cool/cold shower before bed. Sleep with minimal clothing. Your body won't fall asleep if it is hot.



\-Limit blue light from screens. Blue lights will interfere with melatonin production. Use a night screen app or blue-blocking glasses.



\-Magnesium before bed. Idk why it just works.



\-3mg of melatonin/200 mg of L-Theanine will help you relax before bed. 30 mins before.





\-Hard training before sleep will keep your heart rate elevated, making it hard to go to bed.



\-Low vitamin D is associated with sleep disorders. Vitamin D is cheap, safe and effective. Unless you are spending time in the sun, you are probably deficient in vitamin D.
